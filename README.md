# emilioroche.github.io
personal website using github pages (Jekyll build), will be doing multiple iterations to get a handle what works best for me. Will be pushing to main branch first before merging to gh-pages where it will deployed by github to live site

to do:
- essentially look over styling
- any styling from _sass/ needs to be done in the assets/css/main.scss file
- work on adding page for projects
