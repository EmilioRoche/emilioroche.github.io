personal website using github pages (Jekyll build), will be doing multiple iterations to get a handle what works best for me. Will be pushing to main branch first before merging to gh-pages where it will deployed by github to live site

updates:
- changed theme from default to dark


to do:
- introduce title separators
- add site subtitle for version (1.*)
- essentially look over styling
