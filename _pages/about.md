>Bachelor of CS grad with a specialization in Cyber Security & Network Communications at Dalhousie University.

When I graduated high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do, and so I ended up taking a year off to work + explore different career paths. I took an interest in Computer Science, as I was intrigued with the problem solving skill needed for designing and developing software.

During my undergrad, I completed 3 co-ops, in which 2 of them I was developing on a web application. Both co-ops were managed with the **Agile** methodology for their projects and developed their application using **AngularJS Framework** applying either **TypeScript** or **JavaScript** as its primary language.

After graduating, I volunteered my time at a non-profit organization as a **Backend Developer** for their application. They use **MongoDB** for database management, **NodeJS** with **Typescript** for the backend, and using **Azure** for hosting. Other Tools being used are **Docker** for container management.

I am currently employed as a **Full-Stack Developer** at Katipult.
