>Fresh CS grad with a Bachelors of Computer Science with a certificate in Cyber Security & Network Communications at Dalhousie University.

When I graduated high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do, and so I ended up taking a year off to work + explore different career paths. I took an interest in Computer Science, as I was intrigued with the problem solving skill needed for designing and developing software.

During my undergrad, I completed 3 co-ops, in which 2 of them I was developing on a web application. Both co-ops were managed with the **Agile** methodology for their projects and developed their application using **AngularJS Framework** applying either **TypeScript** or **JavaScript** as its primary language.

I am currently looking for job opportunities as a **Junior Developer**/**Software Developer**
### My interests
- Front End Web Development
- Back End Web Development

- Network Security
