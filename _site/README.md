personal website using github pages (Jekyll build), will be doing multiple iterations to get a handle what works best for me. Will be pushing to main branch first before merging to gh-pages where it will deployed by github to live site

updates:
- changed theme from default to dark
- added profile on main page with contact info + bio
- added navigation bar


to do:
- essentially look over styling
- any styling from _sass/ needs to be done in the assets/css/main.scss file
- start looking into adding content into 'posts' section
